Regular build process:
	mkdir build && cd build
	qmake ../
	make
	make install

Debian build process:
	dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
NOTE: if building for armhf, you'll most likely need to build on-device
      (cross-compilation for armhf isn't that easy)

Packages:
apt-get install pkg-tools build-essential libqjson-dev libqxmpp-dev git libqtwebkit-dev
